# InTouch
InTouch is a LinkedIn integration tool that allows users to achieve greater utility out of their connections and network on LinkedIn. InTouch utilizes OAuth to autheniticate and login a user to their LinkedIn profile. Once authenticated, our app should redirect a user back into our app with the ability to drag and drop connections into a calendar. The purpose here is to allow users to group connections together and create an efficient way to remind the user to reach out to groups, recruiters and other individuals on a per-need basis - all while setting calendar reminders on when to do so.
